Hello Techie Brekkie and thanks for clicking on my blog!

Hacking for Muggles is a talk I put together because I believe hacking isn't a superpower, or something that needs skills seen in Swordfish or the Matrix to do. It's a question of creativity, pattern recognition, and experimentation.

My career as a software tester means I (hopefully) get to use these skills on a daily basis, so security vulnerabilities are -- to me -- interesting puzzles to get to the bottom of and interesting to see how they work and were exploited!

But... without further ado...

1. [Moonpig vulnerability](https://darkport.co.uk/blog/moonpig-vulnerability/)
2. [How I used a simple Google query to mine passwords from dozens of public Trello boards](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/discovering-the-hidden-mine-of-credentials-and-sensitive-information-8e5ccfef2724/)
3. [Immobilise: 'Burglar's shopping list' security flaw fixed])https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30686697)

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed the talk!
