    My name is Joseph Ward and Iâ€™m a professional software tester and garden-variety nerd.
    
    Currently, I work for BJSS as a Software Development Engineer in Test. My main areas of interest are 
    coaching, development, testability, and continuously improving the quality culture 
    across our engagements. 

    Outside of work I'm a fan of boardgames (especially Warhammer) and Marvel comic books, not
    that I have much free time as a dad of two energetic girls under ten!
