## Tester, Sparkol (Bristol)

***2016 -- 2017***

[Sparkol's](https://sparkol.com/) mission is to empower people to engage their audience. They make software that anyone, at any skill level, can use to create interesting and engaging presentations.

As the sole tester I was central to Sparkol’s testing strategy, mucking in from day one with anything we wanted to create and squashing bugs before they could appear.

An abbreviated list of my responsibilities includes: peer reviewing, pair programming, automation in testing, exploratory testing, test management of external crowd testing vendors, and organising bug bashes.


## Tester then Test Lead, Hargreaves Lansdown (Bristol)

***2013 -- 2016***

[Hargreaves Lansdown](https://hl.co.uk/) is one of the UK’s biggest financial services companies and aims to give the best service, the best value, and the best information to investors.

Test Lead for the company's external/internal mobile applications. I mainly focused on popularising "shift-left testing" during one of the company's pioneer agile projects.

## Data Enty Operator / Tester, Direct Line (Bristol)

***2010 -- 2013***

[Direct Line](https://www.directline.com/) is an insurance company within the UK.

Originally a Data Entry Operator, I occasionally took the role of Tester for software designed to replace my role. A career change shortly followed.

## Tech

I use whatever technology best solves the problem at hand, not a golden hammer or whatever’s new and shiny. I base my approach on reliable, tried-and-true software development principles and patterns.

That being said, I have implemented so-called “full stack” automation in testing using **C#**, **Python**, **Ruby**, **JavaScript**, and **Java**, not to mention countless supporting libraries.

## Personal

I'm a garden-variety nerd who enjoys comic books, video games, and tinkering with technology. My favorite testing blogs are [Ministry of Testing](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/) and [Senor Performo](https://www.srperf.com/) and my favorite testing books are [How Google Tests Software](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Google-Tests-Software-James-Whittaker/dp/0321803027) and [Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your Tests,](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fifty-Quick-Ideas-Improve-Tests/dp/0993088112/) unless we’re talking fiction in which case I’m a big fan of the Discworld series (especially [Thief of Time](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thief-Time-Discworld-Novel-Novels/dp/0552167649/) and [Thud!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thud-Discworld-Novel-34-Novels/dp/055216769X/)).
